# v1.0.0

- This is the first release of Carbon. Carbon is an unblocking software for users who are impacted by Lightspeed systems.

# v1.0.1

- Encrypted the code so lightspeed will have a harder time patching carbon

# v1.0.2

- Fixed carbon so it now works on fcps computers (not guaranteed). Also I apologize for the lack of updates with carbon (school sucks). I will try my best to make it work until the end of the school year. If you want something added or a problem just open an issue and I will try my best to respond quickly

# v1.0.3

- Changed some ui with the carbon
